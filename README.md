### Example of a regression problem
### Boston Housing Price Prediction

The goal of this project is to predict housing prices in Boston. The data is available in Keras with the name 'boston_housing'.

## Dataset Information

This dataset consists of 506 samples with 13 features, where 404 samples are for training data and 102 samples are for testing data.

## Loading the Dataset

This section loads the Boston housing dataset for further analysis.

## Preparing the Data (Normalized Data)

The Standardization method is used to normalize data using the numpy library.

## Building the Network

The neural network architecture is defined in this section.

## K-fold Cross-validation

The K-fold cross-validation method is used to evaluate the network.

## Longer Training (Epochs 500) of Network and Storage Score Validation

This section describes the process of training the network for a longer duration and storing validation scores.

## Plotting Validation Scores

This section provides code for plotting the validation scores.

## Smoothing Validation Scores Curve

This section includes code for smoothing the validation scores curve.

## Training the Final Model

This section explains how to train the final model.

## Final Result

The final result and evaluation metric are presented in this section.
